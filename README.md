# Final Project Capstone CS50 Web - Jobfindr

This is CS50 Web. This is my final submission for the Capstone Project of [CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/). Project's specifications and requisites can be found [here](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/projects/final/capstone/).

Jobfindr is a platform (web app) that unites both job candidates and talent hunters together in one place. Easily register for an account and curriculum to attract companies that are looking for people like you. If you are looking for talents to hire instead, create an organization and job postings, searching for people who fits your talent hunting criteria.

## Distinctiveness and Complexity

This section defends the project's disctinctiveness and complexity, and is intended for the course's staff who are responsible for evaluating this project. If you are just interested in running the project at your machine, please head to the [Installation section](#installation) below.

### Distinctiveness

To start judging the project's distinction, it is appropriate to set some parameters regarding distinction and discuss them for better clearance. Those parameters includes, but are not limited to:

1. Have a different theme or problem to solve
2. Be distinct (different) of other projects of this course, in special:  
   2.1.  [CS50W Pizza project](https://docs.cs50.net/web/2020/x/projects/3/project3.html)  
   2.2. Social Network  
   2.3. E-commerce  
   2.4. Other course's projects  
3. Avoid similar features already used in other course's projects

The first factor that makes this project distinct of others is the **problem it proposes to solve**. Jobfindr in itself have an exclusive theme not explored by the project's course (2021 to 2022), the goal of solving communication and bring two target audiences together: people who are seeking a job opportunity, and people who are looking for talents. With that in mind, lets remember the problems that other projects solves, or their themes:

- Project 0 Search: Design a front-end for Google Search, Google Image Search, and Google Advanced Search
- Project 1 Wiki: Design a Wikipedia-like online encyclopedia
- Project 2 Commerce: Design an eBay-like e-commerce auction site
- Project 3 Mail: Design a front-end for an email client
- Project 4 Network: Design a Twitter-like social network website
- Project Pizza (old): Build an web application for handling a pizza restaurantâ€™s online orders

Now that we are familiarized with the course's projects and their themes, we can comment about and compare **Jobfindr**'s goal with theirs, and see if they are distinct or not.

#### Search Project distinction

Search proposes to replicate Google Search, Image Search and Advanced Search pages to improve the student knowledge and practice with HTML, CSS and Git. So we can conclude that Jobfindr and Search are distinct of each other because:

* `Jobfindr` proposes to solve communication and facilitate encounters between job hunters and job seekers.
* `Search` proposes to improve the students skills with HTML, CSS and Git, to make them more familiarized with the base web technologies.

* `Jobfindr` have a wider stack and two target audiences.
* `Search` is just a practice project and with a simple tech stack for beginners.

Considering the points we've discussed, Jobfindr is distinct of Search.

#### Wiki Project distinction

Wiki project proposes to create an online encyclopedia with the capability of creating wiki entries within the website.
